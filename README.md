# Google-Glass-Sound-Activity-OSC-Streaming
Google Glass App for Activity Recognition and OSC Streaming (Sound, Motion Activity, Light Exposure)

This App was created for a context-aware lighting experiment
Sound, motion and light level are streamed in OSC format to a server. 
The lighting is then dynamically adapted based on inferred activity.
